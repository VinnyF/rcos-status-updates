## Last Week's Accomplishments

Further research with LLVM and discussion about switching from the C++ package to Python, since it will be easier to work with.

## This Week's Plan

Migrating work from C++ to the new python project, then continuing research on code generation

## Anything Blocking?

I'm far better at C++ than Python, so this change will be a bit bumpy
