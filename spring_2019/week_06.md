## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I wanted to focus on documentation, it will benefit the entire team to ensure we're all on the same page.
It will also help any users in the future and will also benefit myself as I continue to build the compiler.

## This Week's Plan

Continue documentation and reach out to other team members to fill in any blanks I leave behind.

## Anything Blocking?

Same as last week
