## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, most of the time was spent planning the syntax and reviewing what roles need to be played.
I will most likely be focusing on the C++ portion of the project.

## This Week's Plan

I will begin looking into how LLVM works in order to help develop the compiler.

## Anything Blocking?

I don't understand much of anything that we're doing aside from the languages themselves.
