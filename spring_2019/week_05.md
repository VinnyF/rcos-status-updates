## Last Week's Accomplishments

I was on vacation for spring break and I also had two job interviews, so everything got put on hold.

## This Week's Plan

Rewind a bit and follow a tutorial, ideally one made for python. More explanation in the next section.

## Anything Blocking?

As I learn more, I've realized there are more complexities to this project than I had anticipated.
Because of this, I need to take a step back and look for a more systematic way of using LLVM.
I also need to clarify intentions with the rest of the team regarding syntax.
I have a sample line of code and the resulting AST which I need to fully understand before it can be parsed properly.
