## Last Week's Accomplishments

Further research with LLVM and discussion about switching from the C++ package to Python, since it will be easier to work with.

This week, I migrated my previous work to the python LLVM package.

## This Week's Plan

Continue looking into code generation through LLVM, and how syntax needs to be formatted to actually 
be compatable without having to make changes to the package itself.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm not as good with python and I have trouble learning to use entire packages like this, 
since there is so much information at once
