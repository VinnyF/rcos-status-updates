## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week was spent researching LLVM and discussing how it can be fully utilized to make the compiler.

## This Week's Plan

Continued research of LLVM, focusing on how to use a JSON file and convert the information from that into something useable.

## Anything Blocking?

I honestly don't know what I'm doing. I'm hoping reviewing the LLVM documentation will provide some clarity.
